**Hello!**

I'm [Daniel Rothenberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rothenbergdaniel/). In my professional life I wear a lot of different hats:

- 🌍 I'm an atmospheric/climate scientist with specialization in aerosol-cloud-climate processes.
- ⛈ I'm a meteorologist who works on applying AI to weather forecasting and analysis problems.
- 🏛 I work adjacent to science-for-policy and policy-for-science applications.
- 👨🏻‍💻 I write a lot of code and develop software for many different problem domains.
- 🚗 I help(ed) develop the capability for autonomous vehicles to handle nearly all non-winter weather conditions.
